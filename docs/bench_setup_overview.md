# Bench Setup Overview (Generic)

This is a conceptual example of an ECU bench setup:

- 12 V bench power supply
- ECU-style controller
- CAN interface (USB-CAN, PCI-CAN, or virtual CAN for testing)
- Optional loads / sensors (simulated)

The goal is to demonstrate how you might document and script around such a setup,
not to represent any specific product.
